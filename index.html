    <h1>OBJECTIVES</h1>
    <h6>The study aims to determine the prevalence of 
    mental health challenges among physicians in 
    Canada, identify contributing factors, assess the 
    impact on patient care outcomes and 
    economic costs, evaluate existing support 
    systems, and develop recommendations to 
    enhance mental health support for physicians.

    <h6>According to the Mental
        Health Commission of Canada,
        the report, developed in
        collaboration with the Centre
        for Studies in Primary Care at
        Queen’s University and HEC
        Montréal’s Healthcare
        Management Hub, reveals 40
        per cent of health-care
        workers are burned out, 50 per
        cent intend to leave the
        profession, and just 60 per cent
        are satisfied with the quality of
        care they provide</h6>
    
    <h1>RESULT</h1>
    <h6>There has been a significant increase in mental health
      challenges among Canadian physicians during the COVID-19
      pandemic. This underscores the urgent need for systemic
      changes and enhanced support mechanisms within
      healthcare settings.</h6>

    <h1>INTERVIEW FINDINGS</h1>
    <h6>Physicians encounter emotional challenges 
      when dealing with terminally ill patients, 
      frustration with patient compliance, worklife balance issues, privacy concerns, 
      feelings of isolation, and the impact of 
      burnout on patient care.</h6>

      <h1>RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
    <h6>
      <p class="recommendations">Mental Health Resources for Physicians</p>
      The Physician Wellness Hub, provided by the
      Canadian Medical Association (CMA), is a
      valuable resource for supporting physicians'
      mental well-being. It includes articles on stress
      management, work-life balance, coping
      strategies, and mental health support. The
      platform offers self-assessment tools, peer
      support networks, and dedicated mental
      health resources tailored to physicians' needs.
      
      <p class="recommendations">Team-Based Primary Care Initiatives</p>
      The Canadian Medical Association (CMA)
      advocates a comprehensive approach to
      address Canada's healthcare challenges,
      emphasizing the need for team-based primary
      care. Their recommendations include easing
      the process for internationally trained physicians
      to get licensed, integrating various healthcare
      professionals into primary care teams, and
      advocating for a national health human
      resources strategy. Additionally, the CMA
      emphasizes the importance of reducing
      medical administrative burdens and promoting
      health data sharing across jurisdictions.
      
      <p class="recommendations">Physician Burnout</p>
      The Ontario Medical Association (OMA) has
      identified critical system-level solutions to
      address physician burnout, recognizing its
      significant impact on physicians, patients, and
      the healthcare system. The OMA Burnout Task
      Force suggests comprehensive measures such
      as streamlining documentation, ensuring fair
      compensation, promoting work-life balance,
      integrating telemedicine, and providing
      institutional support for physician wellness. These
      strategies aim to enhance physician well-being,
      improve patient outcomes, and optimize the
      overall performance of the healthcare system.
